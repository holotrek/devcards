# Testing

## @open-wc/testing

See [open-wc.org/testing](https://open-wc.org/testing).

## vanilla-chai

Karma + Mocha + Chai without any helpers. Inspired by open-wc, off course.
Only @open-wc/testing for Karma configuration, as there isn't anything special to say about this part.

## Showroom

As you're looking for information about unit testing with Web Components,
[Showroom](https://github.com/eavichay/showroom) will appear at one time or another.

However, as I write this lines, its last version is 0.9.2, which was released in December 2018 (8 months ago).
And no major contribution to it was made since.

It was created by [Avichay Eyal](https://twitter.com/eavichay), the author of [Slim.js](https://slimjs.com).
As he is the only major contributor to these two very good projects, their maintenance depends heavily on him.
Yet, it seems he doesn't have time for that right now, unfortunately.

Therefor, I can't recommend, for now, to use it for your WC project.
This is why I didn't include a demo in these one.

But I can recommend you to check out [Testing Web Components with showroom](https://medium.com/@eavichay/testing-web-components-fe48a49117f7)
for more information :wink::thumbsup:
